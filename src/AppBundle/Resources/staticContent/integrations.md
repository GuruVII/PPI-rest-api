There are still no integrations made but a Wordpress plugin is being developed. You can help by contributing to the Github page: [wp-pirate-parties](https://github.com/PeterTheOne/wp-pirate-parties)

## I developed 'xyz' using this API, now what?
Great! We would love to list it here and promote to others!
